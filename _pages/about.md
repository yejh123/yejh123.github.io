Currently, I am pursuing a three-year master's degree at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Hai-Tao Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7VPeORoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) in [THUKE Lab](https://github.com/THUKElab). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from South China University of Technology in 2022.

My research focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).  
To be more specific, my research interests lie in:
 - **Text Correction & Education**: Correcting and explaining grammatical errors espcially for primary schoolers and second-language learners.
 - **LLM-based Agent**: Explorations of the reasonning and clarifying capabilities and applications in complex scenarios.

**I am looking for a Ph.D position now**. You can find my CV here: [Jingheng Ye's Curriculum Vitae](../files/CV-Jingheng Ye-20240907.pdf).
