Currently, I am pursuing a three-year M. S. degree in Computer Science at Tsinghua University (清华大学), advised by Prof. [Hai-Tao Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7VPeORoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) of [THUKE Lab](https://github.com/THUKElab). I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from South China University of Technology (华南理工大学) in 2022. 

My research focuses on Grammatical Error Correction (GEC), LLM-based Agent, and Education. You can find my CV here: [Jingheng Ye's Curriculum Vitae](../file/CV-Jingheng Ye-20240801.pdf).
