Currently, I am pursuing a three-year M. S. degree in Computer Science at Tsinghua University (清华大学, THU), advised by Prof. [Hai-Tao Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7VPeORoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) in [THUKE Lab](https://github.com/THUKElab). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from South China University of Technology (华南理工大学, SCUT) in 2022.

My research focuses on Text Correction, LLM-based Agent, and Education. I am looking for a PhD position now. You can find my CV here: [Jingheng Ye's Curriculum Vitae](../files/CV-Jingheng Ye-20240907.pdf).
